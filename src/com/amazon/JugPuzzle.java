You are on the side of the river.
You are given a m liter jug and a n liter jug where 0 < m < n.
Both the jugs are initially empty.
The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities.
You have to use the jugs to measure d liters of water where d < n.
Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d liters of water in one of jug.
The operations you can perform are:

Empty a Jug
Fill a Jug
Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.

Solution 1 (Always pour from m liter jug into n liter jug)
Fill the m litre jug and empty it into n liter jug.
Whenever the m liter jug becomes empty fill it.
Whenever the n liter jug becomes full empty it.
Repeat steps 1,2,3 till either n liter jug or the m liter jug contains d litres of water.
Each of steps 1, 2 and 3 are counted as one operation that we perform.
Let us say algorithm 1 achieves the task in C1 no of operations.

Solution 2 (Always pour from n liter jug into m liter jug)
Fill the n liter jug and empty it into m liter jug.
Whenever the n liter jug becomes empty fill it.
Whenever the m liter jug becomes full empty it.
Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 till either n liter jug or the m liter jug contains d liters of water.
Let us say solution 2 achieves the task in C2 no of operations.
Now our final solution will be a minimum of C1 and C2.
